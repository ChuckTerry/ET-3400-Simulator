  <h2>Motorola 6800 Microprocessor</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6800">Motorola 6800</a> is a significant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_computing">8-bit microprocessor</a> that was introduced in 1974. It was one of the earliest microprocessors developed by Motorola and played a crucial role in the evolution of computing and embedded systems. The 6800 was designed to compete with other early microprocessors like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080">Intel 8080</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">MOS Technology 6502</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>Development and Features</h3>
  <p>Motorola's 6800 microprocessor was developed by a team led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Peddle">Chuck Peddle</a> and Bill Mensch, among others. Its development was part of a broader movement in the early 1970s towards creating more affordable and accessible computing components for a range of products, from industrial applications to personal computers.</p>
  <p>The 6800 operated at a clock speed of 1 MHz and was fabricated using NMOS technology. It had a 16-bit address bus, enabling it to address up to 64KB of memory, which was a significant amount at the time for microprocessors. The 6800's instruction set was designed to be simple yet powerful, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.</p>
  
  <h3>6800 Package Options</h3>
  <p>The Motorola 6800 was sold as a 40-pin Dual Inline Package (DIP).  Three distinct offerings were made available based on your use case.</p>

  <h4>Plastic [MC6800P] [Case 711]</h4>
  <p>The plastic case was the economy option.  For those learning how MPUs function, non-critical applications, or the like, this option didn't break the wallet like its sibling packages</p>

  <h4>Cerdip [MC6800S] [Case 734]</h4>
  <p>The Cerdip package was the step above plastic, both in price and endurance.  This package hermatically selead the silicone, encasing it to protect against the environment.</p>

  <h4>Ceramic [MC6800L] [Case 715]</h4>
  <p>The Juggernaut of the 6800 Lineup and by far the most expensive of the three.  The MC6800L primarily saw use in defense, aerospace, and critical infrastructure.  Able to withstand the harshest environments, it's price reflected this capability</p>
  
  <h3>Impact and Legacy</h3>
  <p>The introduction of the Motorola 6800 had a significant impact on the computing industry. It was used in a variety of applications, including early personal computers, embedded systems, and control systems for industrial equipment. The 6800's architecture and instruction set influenced the design of subsequent microprocessors and microcontrollers from Motorola, leading to the development of the 68000 series, which powered iconic computers like the Apple Macintosh and the
  Commodore Amiga.</p>
  <p>The 6800 also had a notable influence on the development of other microprocessors. For example, after leaving Motorola, Chuck Peddle and Bill Mensch played key roles in the development of the MOS Technology 6502, a microprocessor that became famous for its use in systems like the Apple I and II, the Commodore VIC-20 and 64, and the Nintendo Entertainment System.</p>
  <p>The Motorola 6800 microprocessor is remembered as a pioneering piece of technology that helped lay the groundwork for the modern computing era. Its development marked a key moment in the history of microprocessor design, contributing to the democratization of computing power and the expansion of the digital revolution into homes and businesses worldwide. The 6800's legacy is evident in the evolution of microprocessors and the wide range of technologies they enable today.</p>
